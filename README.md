This repository contains helper scripts for working with a combination of a ProtoTrak MX3 retrofit and SolidWorks CAM

gsplitter:
 * Break the CAM for an assembly down into individual per-operation files
 * Break large operations down into small enough files for the mill (500 command max)
 * Optionally re-number or strip line numbers
